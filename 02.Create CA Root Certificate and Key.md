<!-- /TOC -->

To ensure security, various components of the `kubernetes` system need to use `x509` certificates for encryption and authentication of communications.

CA (Certificate Authority) is a self-signed root certificate used to sign other certificates created subsequently.

The CA certificate is shared by all nodes in the cluster and **needs to be created only once**, and then used to sign all other certificates.

This document uses `CloudFlare`'s PKI toolkit [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) to create all certificates.

Note: Unless specifically stated, all operations in this document are **executed on the idc-k8s-01 node**.

## Install cfssl Toolkit

``` bash

sudo mkdir -p /opt/k8s/cert && cd /opt/k8s/work

wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/download/v1.4.1/cfssl_1.4.1_linux_amd64
mv cfssl_1.4.1_linux_amd64 /opt/k8s/bin/cfssl

wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/download/v1.4.1/cfssljson_1.4.1_linux_amd64
mv cfssljson_1.4.1_linux_amd64 /opt/k8s/bin/cfssljson

wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/download/v1.4.1/cfssl-certinfo_1.4.1_linux_amd64
mv cfssl-certinfo_1.4.1_linux_amd64 /opt/k8s/bin/cfssl-certinfo

chmod +x /opt/k8s/bin/*
export PATH=/opt/k8s/bin:$PATH
```

## Create Configuration File

The CA configuration file is used to configure the root certificate's usage scenarios (profile) and specific parameters (usage, expiration time, server authentication, client authentication, encryption, etc.):

``` bash
cd /opt/k8s/work
cat > ca-config.json <<EOF
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "87600h"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "kubernetes": {
        "usages": [
            "signing",
            "key encipherment",
            "server auth",
            "client auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "876000h"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```
+ `signing`: Indicates that the certificate can be used to sign other certificates (the `ca.pem` certificate generated will have `CA=TRUE`);
+ `server auth`: Indicates that the client can use this certificate to verify the server's provided certificate;
+ `client auth`: Indicates that the server can use this certificate to verify the client's provided certificate;
+ `"expiry": "876000h"`: The certificate's validity period is set to 100 years;

## Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR) File

``` bash
cd /opt/k8s/work
cat > ca-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "kubernetes-ca",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "CN",
      "ST": "BeiJing",
      "L": "BeiJing",
      "O": "k8s",
      "OU": "opsnull"
    }
  ],
  "ca": {
    "expiry": "876000h"
 }
}
EOF
```
+ `CN: Common Name`: The kube-apiserver extracts this field from the certificate as the **username (User Name)** for the request; browsers use this field to verify the legitimacy of a website;
+ `O: Organization`: The kube-apiserver extracts this field from the certificate as the **group (Group)** to which the requesting user belongs;
+ The kube-apiserver will use the extracted `User, Group` as the user identity for `RBAC` authorization;

Note:
1. The combination of CN, C, ST, L, O, and OU in different certificate csr files must be different, otherwise the `PEER'S CERTIFICATE HAS AN INVALID SIGNATURE` error may occur;

2. When creating the csr file of the certificate subsequently, the CN will be different (C, ST, L, O, OU are the same) to achieve the purpose of differentiation;

## Generate CA Certificate and Private Key

``` bash
cd /opt/k8s/work
cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
ls ca*
```

## Distribute Certificate Files

``` bash
cd /opt/k8s/work
source /opt/k8s/bin/environment.sh
for node_ip in ${NODE_IPS[@]}
  do
    echo ">>> ${node_ip}"
    ssh root@${node_ip} "mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes/cert"
    scp ca*.pem ca-config.json root@${node_ip}:/etc/kubernetes/cert
  done
```
